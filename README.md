## Reading List

![Reading List](list.jpg)

This project is a reading list where users can add their to-read books and scratch them out of it, they can also clear it entirely from items whenever they're done, this list was built using React. 

### Tecnologies Used:
- JavaScript
- HTML 
- CSS
- React

### Difficulties
- React was a new technology for me, this project was my first time learning or using it. 
- Using JavaScript in a different environment and different rules.


### Favorite Part:
- Getting to learn more about React during this project week.
- Making a list that I might actually use in my daily life.
